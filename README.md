# Ani V. Blender Addons

These addons are totally random and I made them as and when I had the need to simplfy some repetitive tasks.
Below you can read about each addon and what it does:

-   Add studio lightings:

    - Adds area lights to the scene for quick renders.

- Generate wave path:
    - Generates a wave like curve path with customizable amplitude value.
